# ADM-HW3



In this repository, we find 4 files: 3 files are text file and the other is a Jupyter Notebook. 
The text files have the name: "Boken_File.txt", "Page.txt" and "book_list.txt". In the first text file, we can find all the html files which are damaged and which have been discarded by our analysis. Then, in the "page.txt" file, we find all the url of the pages considered in the analysis. In our study, we considered the first 300 pages of the site: https://www.goodreads.com/. Finally, in the last file, we have the urls of each books contain in the pages. In particular, we have that each page has 100 books, therefore the "book_list.txt" file has 30000 book's url inside. 

The jupyter notebook, called "HW3_ADM", has inside all the code using for the analysis of the website Goodreads. Moreover, we can find inside all the comments at the question.
